## Inspiration üß†

**Tourific** draws inspiration from the joy of discovery and the bonds forged through travel. In a world where time is precious and distractions abound, we envision a platform that simplifies trip planning, enabling friends to embark on journeys that deepen their connections and create lasting memories. Our mission is to cultivate a sense of wonder and belonging, making every trip an opportunity for growth, exploration, and shared experiences.

- **Frontend**: React Native, TypeScipt
- **Backend**: Node.Js, Prisma, Express
- **Authentication**: Firebase
- **Design**: Excalidraw, Hand + Paper
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Web Hosting**: in progress
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

<!--  ## Architecture üêô

We aim to have a highly modularized architecture, where every service has its own container and is independent from the others.

BookHub has 6 containers for 6 services:

- web: client code / front end
- db: database (SQLite3)
- nginx: reverse proxy
- cadvisor: monitoring tool 1
- prometheus: monitoring tool 2
- grafana: monitoring tool 3

![architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35150672/130304480-28e9b998-dfb2-4919-82de-d4da9a258bb5.jpeg)
-->

## Challenges we ran into ü•∫

- Time Management: At the end of the project, we have 4 different timezones to juggle (Eastern US, Canada, Australia, Vietnam). Thus someone has to wake up really early and someone has to stay really late for our weekly meetings!
- We are not frontend masters, so we struggle with making our website as pretty as possible (We have to redesign nearly everything in the last few weeks).
- Bugs everywhere: The more we build, the more bugs appear and they are everywhere! We spent a lot of time debugging and making sure our app doesn't have any major fault the present user to have a smooth experience.
- Spotify Authentication: Many music streaming service closed their APIs to the public, and we can only find Spotify available. But Spotify requires user to log in and must have premium account. The authentication flow is also confusing at first.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of ü•∞

- Despite the time commitment issues, we were able to create a final deliverable at the end and learnt a lot in the process.
- We have a great teamwork - unexpected things happen, but no one is blamed and we keep moving forward and working together to find a solution.
- We built off of the feedbacks we received from our project advisors through out the whole process (giant thanks to [@khoa165](https://github.com/khoa165), [@ankhuetang](https://github.com/ankhuetang), [@Taenerys](https://github.com/Taenerys)).
- We demonstrated great Git best practices (Pull Requests, README.md, Code Review, etc.)
- We learned a lot as a team and as individual. We built many cool features and now have mastered using a lot of APIs!

## What we learned üí°

- Acting as a Project Manager: deciding the direction of the project, assigning tasks, holding meetings, taking notes, being encouraging, etc.
- Good GitHub practices.
- Good collaboration between teammates.
- Never afraid to ask questions / for help.

## What's next for PeacePod ü§´

- [ ] Improve on UI/UX
- [ ] Enhance algorithm's efficiency
- [ ] Launch the app!
